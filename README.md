### Time-series-forecasting-for-influenza-like-illness
#### In this project, the prediction of influenza-like illness treated as a time series forecasting problem. Various classical time series methods like  AR, MA, ARIMA, etc. has been used. Apart from this some variants of RNN-LSTM in deep learning also implemented. The time-series forecasting problem can also be seen as a multivariate time series problem. So, we used technique VAR as well. In the repository, we have added two datasets for univariate and multivariate forecasting.
